## present
I live in London, in the UK 🇬🇧

I work as a software consultant, but I'm a hardware guy at heart. I'm also becoming increasingly involved in startups and personal projects.

I run a lot, explore the UK on my motorbike, and tinker with cameras in my spare time.

## past
- 🇳🇿 I was born and raised in Greytown, in the Wairarapa region of New Zealand.

- 🤖 I studied Mechatronics at Massey University, but it was a heavily robotics focussed curriculum. That's where I learned to code. I built a robot that could pick up really, [*really* small things](https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Grab-and-release-trial-on-173mmdocumentclass12ptminimal-usepackageamsmath_fig4_328941199), and wrote [a paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327522823_Development_of_a_Micromanipulation_Platform_with_Passive-Active_Hybrid_Release_Strategy_for_Single-Cell_Separation) about it

- ✈️ After uni, I took a Control Systems Engineering job at a consultancy. We designed systems that would safely get fuel to fighter jets (among other, much less sexy things).

- 🗼 I wanted to focus on code, so I moved on to a role at Transpower, NZs national grid operator. NZ has ~23,000 transmission towers and they all need looking after. I built models that would predict which towers needed the most attention.

- 🌍 Then, I wanted to travel. I sold everything I had and spent 6 months travelling Europe and the UK. The energy sector roped me back in, and I wound up working for National Grid via my employer, Mesh-AI, developing AI-powered planning tools. My current engagement is to help build a data platform for an energy trading organisation.

## future
In the future, I want to work part time so I can focus on family, creativity and community. This will probably mean building a business of my own, or contributing signficantly to ventures by others. In the last couple years, I've started to make changes towards that goal. This site is one of those changes. So, thanks for your help.
