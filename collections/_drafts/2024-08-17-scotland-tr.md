# Getting Licensed
In 2023, I decided I wanted to get licensed to ride a motorcycle. I had travelled by train, plane and car through europe and the UK and felt that I wanted a bit more freedom in my adventures.

on the 23rd July, I passed my CBT, which licensed me to ride 125cc motorcycles. Looking at insurance, it was going to cost me £3000 to insure even a £1000 bike. So, I had no choice but to push forward to a full license and get insured.

I took a few training courses on bigger bikes, which are a different beast entirely to the 125s. I got on a Triumph Trident 660, which was an awesome bike that handled like a dream and felt well put together.

With various successes and failures through training, I made it through module 1 and module 2 with one resit and got fully licensed in January 2024.

# Getting a Bike
Initially I wanted a cool old bike, like an Africa Twin RD07. With the carby and all. I realised I wouldn't really be able to appreciate it. Maybe a second or third bike.

So I went for something a bit more practical. Filtered down to CBF600s, Gladius and SV650s, CB600Fs, NC750s, etc. ABS brakes were a must-have, because I spoke to my mum over the preceding christmas and she made me promise to be safe. I wound up getting a 2008 Suzuki Bandit 650 ABS, with 8700 miles on the clock. It turned out to have been converted from faired to naked via slightly unscrupulous means. I still fell in love with it as soon as it rolled off the transport.

My friend Harry bought a 2007 Bandit. Surprising number of differences - carburetted, oil-cooled, cable clutch, etc. Worked well to have his bike to look at as I tried to figure out what exactly the previous owner had done in modifying my bike.

# Planning the Trip
Harry's Colleague had mentioned the North Coast 500, so we went with that. Initially we went for mid-May, but neither of us were anywhere near prepared, I having purchased, but not taken delivery of my bike, and Harry having not found one at all. I cancelled my leave and rebooked some months later for a week beginning 17th August. There was a bank holiday on the 26th, so we had 9 full days to get north, tour, and get back south. We did some practice rides through to a bikers Cafe on Box Hill - Ryka's - and another trip out to Old Wardour Castle that was cut short due to a fraying clutch cable on the older bandit. The practice rides proved invaluable for me to gain my confidence. We started to gather kit - tail packs, rain gear, mosquito nets, tents and sleeping bags. I installed a phone charger on my bars. Bank balances suffered, but the trip was on.

I'd been up late the previous night packing and repacking, so getting up at 6 was brutal. A strong coffee saw me right though. After so much preparation, it was so satisfying to see the bike full laden and prepared for the journey. The tail pack I'd agonised over choosing worked fantastically, and I figured out a devious method of getting the tent and sleeping bag to attach to the pillion bar which had me feeling smug.

I noodled off just after 7:30 through a crisp morning in London. Over Battersea Bridge, up through West Brompton, past a car crash (a Range Rover inexplicably on it's roof in a 30mph zone, on a street hardly twice it's width). Aired tyres in Denham. Onto a Welcome Break in Oxford to link up with Harry and have a greasy breakfast to fortify ourselves for the trip.

The trip North was a blur. 9 hours of motorway to Lesmahagow. It was immediately apparent we'd not packed warm enough. Harry didn't pack his jacket liner and I only had summer gloves. As a result the clutch and front brake were hard to operate. I learned some months later that the trip wore my rear brakes down to metal.

The rain started to set in maybe 30 minutes before we got to Lesmahagow. Until that point the cold weather was bearable, but that tipped it over. With 15min to go Harry pulled over and had to put his coveralls on, said he was getting basically hypothermic - he just had a basic motorcycle jacket with a jumper underneath.

We pulled into the accomodation in Lesmahagow in drizzle. The vibe was a bit weird admittedly, dead quiet and we had no idea how to check in. In my mirrors I saw a guy with facepaint on an e-scooter zoom past. I thought I was just being delirious for the long ride. Turns out it was a Hare Krishna commune. Nothing against that, but it was a bit unexpected. Cheap lodging at any rate. We walked into Lesmahagow and attempted to order dinner at what claimed to be the best chippy in the UK. We didn't understand their accent and they didn't understand ours. Luckily everything on the menu was some combination of meat and chips so we just pointed. Some kids were across the road while we ate, beating the piss out of a park bench. Not a heap of entertainment in Lesmahagow for the wee ones, I guess?

The next day we had a sleep in and boosted to Glasgow around 9:30 to catch up with my mates Jamie, Kath and Calan from NZ. Jamie and Kath had just finished travelling Europe and Calan (Jamie's brother) was living in Glasgow. We had such an awesome time catching up. I started what would become a daily tradition of inhaling a full scottish breakfast.

They saw us off on our way to Inverness. We went through Stirling, and visited the Wallace Monument. Was pretty cool. On our way up the hill, some australians overheard me talking shit and laughed, which gave me a big head. I was spouting some shit about only coming here to see mel gibson. I don't think I've seen any mel gibson movie, let alone braveheart.

We stopped in Inverness to get groceries (hummus, pita bread and some sort of rice bowl), then on to Dingwall, where we had a cabin airbnb on a rural property. It was awesome. The hosts came out in woolen cardigans, and thick accents to meet us, and see us off. Chickens were clucking around. There was fresh milk in a mini fridge. It was dead quiet, hills rolling into the distance. It reminded me of home.

There was a book on the shelf, Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead, by Olga Tokarczuk. It had a blue cover. I read some of it.

I needed film for my camera and some winter gloves. My Bandit didn't (yet) have heated grips installed and I had some Pando gloves purchased on cool factor. They are cool as fuck, so cool in fact that I couldn't feel my fingers.

Lunch at a random eatery in Munlochy. Toasted sandwich with a side of salad and a... handful of crisps?

Boost over to Ullapool, filling up at Contin, and missing a bloody epic shot of the dam at Loch Glascarnoch (google images shows me that it's been thrashed to death, so I don't feel so bad now). Qualifying what shots are worth stopping for is an art I'm terrible at. You pass the scene, and over the subsequent five minutes of riding you realise it wasn't gonna get better than that. I guess you gotta know when to hold 'em, and indeed, when to fold 'em.

Stop for coffee at Ullapool. Some cool opportunities for shots there, but I didn't take much.

Winding through the white-walled cottages in Ardmair. Stop for photos on the eastern shore of Loch Assynt - Ardvreck Castle was the subject, somewhere within which I assume is a chest containing an elven broadsword enchanted with 30 points of shock damage. Onward to Durness, where we park up at a bed+breakfast, completely buggered. We made sure to walk to walk to the beach before packing it in, and I got a few nice shots.

## TODO add shots of durness beachfront, Ardvreck, etc

# Tuesday, 20/08/24
Wild Orchid Guest House in Durness to John O' Groats. Eat at Olive Cafe in Thurso and stop off in Dunnet Head on the way.

# Wednesday, 20/08/24
John O' Groats to Muir of Ord near Inverness.

Drop the bike pulling over to change gloves in burn of latheron?
Stop to eat at Dalmore farm shop + restaurant. Go to the coop and get a salad because we want vegetables

# Thursday, 20/08/24
Ord Arms Hotel near Muir of Ord out to Portree in Skye, double back to Kyle of Lochaish

See the two guys in Portree with the Tiger/GS who point out applecross.

# Friday, 20/08/24
Shepherds Hut in Kyle of Lochaish to Camping Pod Heaven via Applecross.

See the guy at the top of applecross swearing to himself. See the cyclists. Eliean Donan castle was cool. Get a "morning roll". Have lunch at the Applecross in, served by Australian lady. Stop for heaps of photos over applecross.

# Saturday, 20/08/24
Camping Pod Heaven Inverness to Edinburgh. Catch up with Dan, catch his set. Have a good yarn with Harry.

# Sunday, 20/08/24
Edinburgh to Clapham via Manchester. Massive downpour one we hit the M6 near the lake district. Push through 30 mins to Tebay Services and mong indoors for 90 minutes recharging. Rain lets up a bit. Back on the saddle an hour to Welcome Break, gas/coffee. Push an hour to the next welcome break. Push an hour to the next again in Warwick. Push 2hours to get home at 8pm., harry splits off at Oxford.
