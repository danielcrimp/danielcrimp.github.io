Until recently, organisms on earth (humans, for example) looked something like this:

sensory information -> neural network -> behaviour

At some point, organisms - particularly humans - started externalising memory to their environment, to augment memory and improve communication with other humans.

sensory information -> neural network -> behaviour

                      v            |
                      ---records---

Here I've used "records" to represent externalised records in general. It could just as easily be cave paintings, scratches on a stick, stone tablets, books, databases, etc.

Externalised records were instrumental in humanity's progress in farming, commerce, science, among many other things.

However, records require management:
- You need to recall why you wrote down what you wrote down, and communicate this to any other users of the record
- You need to update the system of recording as requirements change, and backpopulate or flag missing entries

As humanity grew, organisations also increased in prominence, born from demand goods and services. Systems of record, and machine automation of record handling, meant organisations as a species would grow to previously unimaginable scale, with global power and influence rivalling or eclipsing entire countries.

However, the task of managing systems of record increased accordingly - spawning generations of engineers.

If one looks at organisations as organisms in their own right,
