title: Does data exist in nature?

summary: Thinking about what the hell it is we're doing.

Businesses are first-class citizens of western societies today. They even have corporate personhood, which David Graeber has some interesting thoughts about. They shape our societies, similar to how cars have shaped how we design our cities, often to the detriment of pedestrians.

We even expect quite conscious behaviour from corporations. We expect them to be consistent and not contradict themselves. We expect them to read the room, and be conscious of their own image - just as we do humans. This is fair - we should be designing pro-human systems.

Humanity has somewhat arbitrarily defined what is and isn't an organism. Apparently biologists argue a lot about what is and isn't a bee, or a mollusc. We have decades of effort spent on deciding which box we as a species (what's a species?) decide to put a particular bundle of cells.

At every scale of life, constituents interact, pass messages, battle, reproduce, die off. This happens in cell cultures, gut biomes, immune systems, organs, communities, ecosystems, planets. At whatever scale, the picture of life is similar.

David's point on corporate personhood is very interesting to me, because it sparks the idea that corporations may as well be living things in the spirit of the term. Immensely powerful living things, often having more presence in global psyche - and indeed more headcount - than entire nations.

So. Why is it that companies trip over themselves, operate obscenely inefficiently, create human-hostile experiences, and all the other hallmarks of dystopia that have us feeling worried about the future? Why have we created alien beings with inhuman interests?

I divide this predicament into two sub-problems. 

The first is a glaring and well documented issue with these massive corporations: incentive structures that are misaligned with humanity's best interests. That is, corporations typically operate to maximise shareholder value and that's the end of it.
<!-- 
However, even industries with heavy regulation and incentive structures operate with inefficiencies that mean they concede incentive payments. Conversely, the most villainous corporations could stand to gain more if they could stop tripping over themselves. -->

The second, and I believe least-appreciated part of this predicament is that these pseudo-organisms simply don't have the faculties to operate in a manner that we can reason with as human beings. I believe that in producing corporate superpowers, we have created organisms without the mental capacity to operate effectively to the standards we expect. However, The weakest link in all of their processing is always a human having a slow day or not being told the right thing.

We've made significant ground in improving the consciousness of corporations by creating software that can automate a lot of the menial work that no human would have the attention span to do. However, this software is also limited by human capability. Even the most capable software engineers cannot produce software that handles every edge case. Software is necessarily a simplification of real tasks in order to effectively batch-process things that need to be done at scale. The resultant automations - no matter how cerebral and abstract - have a shelf life. Eventually an instance occurs that the well-meaning software engineer didn't think of.

A component of almost every piece of software is a database. These are usually relational databases with schemas that are very difficult to change. For the purposes of this argument, databases are essentially a slower but larger form of memory. ORMs (Object Relational Mappers) are pieces of software used to map database records to in-memory objects for processing. Abstractions in application code are hard enough to refactor as it is, but the abstraction needs to change throughout, ORMs, middleware and database schemas. In short, changing what an organisation believes "a thing" to be requires ridiculous amounts of effort - at worst an entire redesign of the surrounding system. Some of our best and brightest spend their entire careers maintaining, extending and redesigning these immensely complex systems. They also expect handsome remuneration for their work.

Consider that somewhere out in the ether is a figure that represents the proportion of global salary that goes to people who write code. Consider also that mistakes happen in this field.

My point is - we are throwing more and more of our resources, including the cream of our youth, into ~~financial~~ technical activities ~~remote from~~ tangential to the production of goods and services, into activities that generate high private rewards disproportionate to their social productivity.

For organisations to function in our best interests at the scale and breadth we require to continue our journey as a species, we cannot rely on a cottage industry of human engineers to impose, install and uproot fragile concepts of their own design. No human has the ability to design enduring automations that globally optimise the behaviour of these organisational entities in an environment wherein requirements are constantly changing.

# TODO
- look into "does data exist in nature?" question
- introduct "minds and clipboards" idea
- talk about why current approaches are faster horses
