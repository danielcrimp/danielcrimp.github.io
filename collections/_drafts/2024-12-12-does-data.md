summary: Thinking about what the hell it is that we're doing.

Until recently, organisms on earth (humans, for example) looked something like this:

sensory information -> neural network -> behaviour

At some point, organisms - particularly humans - started externalising memory to their environment, to augment their own minds and improve communication with other humans.

sensory information -> neural network -> behaviour
                      |            ^
                      v            |
                      ---records---

Here I've used "records" to represent externalised records in general. It could just as easily be cave paintings, scratches on a stick, stone tablets, books, databases, etc.

Externalised records were instrumental in humanity's progress in farming, commerce, science, among many other things.

However, records require management:
- You need to recall why you wrote down what you wrote down, and communicate this to any other users of the record
- You need to update the system of recording as requirements change, and backpopulate or flag missing entries

As humanity grew, organisations also increased in prominence, born from demand goods and services. Systems of record, and machine automation of record handling, meant organisations as a species would grow to previously unimaginable scale, with global power and influence rivalling or eclipsing entire countries.

However, the task of managing systems of record increased accordingly - spawning generations of engineers. Designing software - systems of record and automation - became a highly sought after and highly regarded skill. 

If one looks at organisations as organisms in their own right, they have quite unusual properties:
- They are often internally inconsistent
- They are hostile to unrecognised patterns, which is often humans
- They are hugely inefficient

I believe this is because organisations have grown to a scale where - even with armies of software engineers - they can no longer effectively interact with the world in a way we can rationalise with as humans. I believe the root of this incapability is that too much of the thinking that happens at an organisation is in the space of low-dimensional records.

Consider first a woman selling goods at a market in 2000 BCE. She might keep record of her sales such that she can flip back two, three weeks, and get a picture for how things have been going, and adjust her prices. At the same time, she can hold a conversation with you about her goods - answer any questions and offer expertise, offer cheaper prices or set goods aside depending on her customers' needs. Most importantly, she can hear your story and interact with you *as a human*. You are reduced to an entry in her system of record for assisting memory, but transacted with as a human being.

Now consider interacting with a 21st century insurance provider, bank or government. You are dealt with primarily as an entry in a system of record, and occasionally you might get to speak to a human to help you understand their systems.

Interacting with an organisation is interacting with a being that has a reductive idea of who you are, and limited means to handle your situation if you don't fit their model.

I believe that, somewhat counterintuitively, artificial neural networks could be the antidote to many of the dystopic experiences we see as hallmarks of existence in today's societies. Further, I believe that what will catapult us into the future will not be machine intelligence applied to pioneer exciting new domains. Instead, I believe it will be less glamorous areas lower in the hierarchy of needs - management, planning, accounting and governance - that will stand to yield the largest gains, once fully automated. This would finally give humanity the time to focus on creative, meaningful endeavours more in line with our goals of self actualisation.
