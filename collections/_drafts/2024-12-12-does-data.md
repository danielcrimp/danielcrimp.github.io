summary: Thinking about what the hell it is we're doing.

Businesses are first-class citizens of western societies today. They even have corporate personhood, which David Graeber has some interesting thoughts about.

What's interesting is that we even expect quite conscious behaviour from companies. We expect them to be consistent and not contradict themselves. We expect them to read the room, and be conscious of their own image.

Humans have somewhat arbitrarily defined what is and isn't an organism. Apparently biologists argue a lot about what is and isn't a bee. We have decades of effort spent on deciding which box we as a species (what's a species?) decide to put a particular bundle of cells?
