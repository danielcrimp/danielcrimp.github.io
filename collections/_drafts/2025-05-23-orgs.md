Main points:
- humans are "designed" to live and talk to other humans
- the highest possible level of service is having someone else attend specifically to your needs
- from a cybernetics perspective, organisations are essentially sentient
- organisations' brains were once entirely their people and organisational structure
    - physical and communicative boundaries limited these organisations' capabilities
- software has enabled us to offload an increasing share of the cognitive load of organisations to machines
    - paper -> spreadsheets -> applications -> etc.
- a property of traditional software is that designed abstractions are required.
    - These are necessarily simplifications of things in the world - people, products, materials, etc.
    - They reflect the organisations' understanding of the world
    - They have a practical ceiling to their complexity
- designed abstractions alienate. Institutions that use designed abstractions (traditional software) alienate and fail to serve their constituents.
- Recent advances in machine intelligence represent software that understands the world in a far richer way than traditional software.
    - this can be exemplified when comparing an latent space vector - a models encoding of its input data - to a 5-column relational database record and accompanying input form
    - a latent representation of an object an ML model has thousands of dimensions - GPT-2 Large had 1280 dimensions
    - a relational database table might have 5 columns. Let's say [name,  age, email_address, subscription, location] 
        - these are essentially the internal representation of your average software product.
        - they have been learned by software development best practices over the course of decades
        - they are simple, but effective. However, edge cases inevitably appear that this representation cannot address - for example, what if the user travels alot, and has no consistent location?
        - they had to be simple because software upkeep and design iterations are insanely expensive and bug squishing is really hard
    - having technology that can automate learning of representations means we can let go of simple representations and instead embrace rich representations
    - having complex representations is becoming super cheap, like having a class in Python with 300 properties/methods - they are all meaningful and applicable to the product
- I have an optimistic accelerationist stance on this:
    - Traditional, designed software results in countless damaging effects on society, and is central to the feeling of inhumane dystopia
    - Advances in machine intelligence will mean organisations will be able to provide service approaching that of humans
    - Interacting with organisations will be more democratic in the future, and fewer people will fall outside of service.
    - we used to have human friendliness; then we had scale at the cost of human friendliness; soon we might be able to have both!
    - We are currently at peak digitalism; things will get more human-friendly from here!
    - imagine if a bank was just one person that understood the whole thing, and could talk to all of it's customers in person simultaneously
    - imagine if you could walk up to a water engineer and mention a leak you noticed in your neighbourhood, and suddenly another engineer is dispatched

in summary:
- software abstractions aren't just like latent representations; they *are* latent representations, learned by organisations with products 
- ensiliconising the act of learning, implementing and manipulating abstractions means their complexity is no longer constrained by the practical limitations of a human engineering workforce
- rich internal representations of the environment will mean companies can serve humans better and adapt as more is learned about the environment
- organisations may one day be able to interact with humans in a super user friendly manner and be able to get out of our way
    - no more forms
    - no more calls to tech support
    - no more QR codes
    - no more 2fa
    - no more poorly designed software
    - no more advertising? please
- history has shown these improvements won't shake out like my optimistic view and you could argue that the modes in which we're subjectified would become oodles more powerful and more sinister but I reckon there could be a future in which we surpass a technological threshold that all of these decades of technological bullshit kinda pay themselves off - where we're relieved from human-hostile technology and human-friendly tech is commonplace and cheap and gets out of our way
