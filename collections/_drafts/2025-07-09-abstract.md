Recently I've been quite interested in a field called Cybernetics. I'm firmly in the armchair on this, but the perspective from Cybernetics is to view systems of any variety (control systems, software, organisations, humans) as sentient, and assess their sensory inputs, decisioning and actions accordingly. The prominent model for these systems is quite similar to a Markov Decision Process.
