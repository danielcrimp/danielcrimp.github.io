An idea I've found to be applicable across many domains is dimensionality of thinking.

This seems to have influence in engineering, design, government, corporations, technology, mental health, software and of course machine learning.

Any thinking system will need to develop an internal representation of things in it's environment in order to predict what will happen next and act on it.

Some systems, due to the scale of their operation and complexity of their tasks, are too limited in capacity to handle many dimensions of representation. For example, bureaucratic organisations need to keep systems of record and communication simple to be able to process information at all.

There is also an element of power and imposition. In governments or monopolistic private enterprises that provide something that people need, the terms of engagement can be set by the provider. In this exchange, the consumer needs to interact in the way that suits the schema of the provider. This constitutes most of subjugation.

In software engineering, engineers design simplifications of objects in the environment such that a computer can easily process them. A very common simplification of a human might be:

```
class User:
    username
    email
    first_name
    last_name
    employee_id
    department
    role
    location
