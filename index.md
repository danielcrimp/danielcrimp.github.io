# Hi. I'm Dan.

### I'm an engineer 🛠️<br/>I build things in the cloud during the week 🌩️ <br/>and on the ground during the weekends 🏍️
<br>
Currently, I work at [Mesh-AI](https://mesh-ai.com/), a digital consultancy based in the UK.

I'm a big fan of technology, running, photography, and making things people care about.
